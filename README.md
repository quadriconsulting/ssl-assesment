# ssl-assesment
Bulk SSL Assessment and Certificate Expiry Detection
Our friend Ivan RistiÄ‡ created the SSL assessment api for https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ problem,
if you wanted to assess hundreds or perhaps thousands of urls automatically, it's not ideal to do them one by one.
with ssl-assessment you simply feed it a file containing all your urls and it'll check and send you the report in an email.
I have personally used the free version of heroku to host it and works great.
